            <p>The Union Buildings in Pretoria, South Africa, are an iconic symbol of the country's unity and democracy. Designed by Sir Herbert Baker and completed in 1913, they house the administrative offices of the government. The buildings gained international attention as the site of Nelson Mandela's presidential inauguration in 1994, 
              marking the end of apartheid. Today, they remain a significant landmark and are open to the public, offering panoramic views and historical insight.</p>
